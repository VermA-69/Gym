    The gym is a great place to build strength, improve endurance, and boost overall health. Whether you're lifting weights, doing cardio, or taking a group class, consistency is key to seeing results. <br> 

    <p>Here are a few gym tips: </p>
    🏋️ **Warm-up** – Prepares your body and reduces injury risk. <br> 
    💪 **Progressive overload** – Gradually increase weights or intensity for muscle growth. <br>  
    🥗 **Nutrition matters** – Fuel your body with protein, carbs, and healthy fats. <br> 
    😴 **Rest & recovery** – Muscles grow when you rest, not just when you lift.  <br>
    🎯 **Set goals** – Whether it's strength, fat loss, or endurance, having a goal keeps you motivated.  <br>
